    "text": "1.1 General background\nThe Covid 19 pandemic showed structural challenges of national economies all over the world, specifically the fragility of neoliberal policies in times of crisis and the lack of industrial and economic resilience. Six years after the fact, our societies are now confronted with inevitable novel challenges and looming shocks. We are already witnessing the consequences of AI development as it paves the way for a new technological revolution that would render most local economies obsolete and cause massive unemployment in white collar sectors. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to be the end of the shocks the world has seen recently as the war in Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, and most importantly the current, chaotic trade wars, seem to foster ever increasing uncertainties. Facing all this, policy makers are confronted with a simple choice; strategise and plan for more resilient local economies. In different streams of literature, resilience is directly related to diversification/variety, whether in portfolio management in finance, trade partnerships/linkages, industrial activities, or in terms of knowledge as well. Thus we can equivalently say that resilience is the capacity to resist and/or adapt to external shocks by relying on exiting internal capabilities that evolve in the face of such shocks. This means that for an economy to survive uncertainties, it needs to evolve, change, and innovate its way to the other end of the bleak challenges it’s confronted with. However, to evolve, change and innovate, a baseline of knowledge should be leveraged since the consensus is that variety is a buffer against external shocks and shields uncertainties. This chain of thoughts, takes us back to the conceptual basics of sustainable economic development and growth; the knowledge fabric is what facilitate any long term strategy, and has been shown in the literature as clear catalyst for societal prosperity and economic resilience. For this reason the study of knowledge is detrimental for policy making, and understanding how to increase its diversity is more relevant than ever before.\nKnowledge is a set of information that covers one or many topics, and its characteristics are contingent on the different forms it can take or how it was created, generally speaking, academia and businesses are the main knowledge creators in any economy through research and patents. Essentially, knowledge can be codified (accessible by anyone through any medium), or tacit (personal information based on social connections, intuition, experience, etc, that’s hard to share with others). The consensus in the literature is that the main driver of competitive advantage for firms is the tacit form of knowledge, which is also widely acknowledged that it’s space dependent. However, the knowledge produced by firms can be reliably seen in patents, although they capture codified information, they also reveal tacit knowledge and its geographic footprint in space. This means that its detrimental to assess the knowledge in patenting activities (we refer to this knowledge as technologies), and more so to focus on the local aspect of these activities i.e: sub-national regions.\nThis framing, however, is not at all new or novel. In fact, this is the entire aim of the literature of the geography of innovation; to study how innovation is created and diffused to different actors in different geographical contexts. Specifically, relatedness and economic complexity (REC) is one of the main streams of literature that focus on the relationships between activities and geographies. The conceptual and methodological framework that REC provides is widely used and adopted in academia and among policy practitioners and was one of the main contributors to the smart specialisation policy literature. The ideas embedded in this framework, to put it simply, rely on the premise of spatial dependence of tacit knowledge in local/regional economies/geographies and focus on simplifying these relationships using network science to model the relationships between knowledge and regions. Albeit these simplifications provide valuable scope for analysis and interpretation, the cost from the loss of granular information implies that there’s much more conceptual, methodological, and empirical work needed. The reason for this is because the loss of information bias the empirical interpretation in the sense that we end up with a homogeneous implication with weak regards to the regional and national contexts as well as the technological characteristics. This work is motivated by this gap and aims to simply contextualise the study of knowledge diversification using the same granular information publicly available and commonly used in the REC literature. The idea is simple, account for endogenous and exogenous contexts using granular data and understand the contexts and contingencies that drives regional diversification.",

    "title": "1  Introduction",
    "section": "1.2 Problem statement",
    "text": "1.2 Problem statement\nThe main problem that this works aims to solve is directly embedded in the methodological and empirical framework of REC. REC models diversification through network aggregation based on co-location and co-occurrence patterns. Using these patterns, different aggregations are used to quantify relatedness (the frequency of observing a pair of activities in the same region), and relatedness density (how much of the activities frequently observed together a region has). However, these measures are often interpreted not as aggregations of frequent observations but rather as relationship models. Empirically, diversification is studied using these constructs as predictors of entry, that is a region’s entry to a new specialisation in a new technology, often considered as a binary outcome. In here we briefly outline the big picture in the REC methodological and empirical framework, its conceptual issues, its empirical consequences, and highlight the research gap.\n\n1.2.1 Relatedness, relatedness density, and diversification\nRelatedness and relatedness density are essentially measures of proximity. In a sense they describe how close two technologies are close to each other, or how close a given technology is to a region given its portfolio of technologies. To further decompose the problem here, we will first establish the methodological constructs for proximity measures. For relatedness that’s co-occurrence, and for relatedness density that’s the linear aggregation of relatedness.\nFirst, co-occurrence is essentially the frequency of observing two activities together. In the REC literature, this frequency describes the strength of the relationship. Activities frequently observed together are more related than the pairs rarely observed together.\nSecond, linear aggregation of relatedness essentially measures the percentage of co-located technologies in a region that are related to a reference technology. Thus, we can think about relatedness density as the link between related technologies and co-located technologies. The idea in the REC literature states that relative to a given technology, the more related technologies a region has, the more likely that it can develop that technology.\nThese two constructs are used together to predict the probability that a region will enter a new technology. The REC literature shows that relatedness density is consistently associated with higher probabilities in almost all studies. These results among others were one of the major latent contributors to smart specialisation strategy (S3) policy. Thus the consensus in the literature was clear: In order to diversify into new technologies with the highest likelihood of success, regions must prioritise investment in related technologies.\n\n\n1.2.2 Empirical consequences\nThe idea of resilience is not a main focus for the REC literature nor it is ours. However, falling back to this concept allows us to further assess the empirical consequences of the mainstream interpretation of relatedness and relatedness density. The idea is that in order to be resilient to external shocks and subsequent uncertainties diversification is key. But what kind of diversification is required and feasible and how to achieve it is the focus here. The REC literature tells us that the most likely successful diversification strategy is the one that targets related capacity in the regions, often referred to as related variety. However, generalising this recommendation is not that straight forward. Aggregate regional capacities and their national and broader geographic contexts differ significantly. The initial landscape of the regional technological portfolio is detrimental here because this strategy could favour regions with already diverse portfolio but it’s questionable that regions with limited portfolios would equally benefit. This is aligned with the concept of path dependency, related variety without context enforces that dependency and locks regions within their limited capacities. This brings us back to the core focus of in this work; context is key. However, context on its own here might not be enough since path dependency of related variety is a direct result of how relatedness and relatedness density is calculated and interpreted. The constructs that enable these measures (co-occurrence and linear aggregation) are the core problem that we’re highlighting here. The reason behind this specific focus relied on the implicit assumptions embedded in these methodological constructs.\nCo-occurrence assumes that technologies frequently observed together are likely related. Although this is within the boundaries of common sense, it’s highly unlikely that’s actually the case. A frequency measure is only informative when we have more observations than items—that is, more geographies than technologies. Almost always, we will have more technologies than geographies, this means that relatedness is at best noisy. Additionally, relatedness as interpreted in the literature quantifies the relationship between pairs of technologies. However, as it stands, there’s no differentiation in the direction of that relationship thus, assuming that the relationship between two technologies is symmetrical. Albeit this assumption in itself is not problematic, it exacerbates the linearity issue when we measure relatedness density as we loose information in co-occurrence, symmetry, and linear aggregations. This takes us to the final issue we would like to highlight; relatedness density. Simply put, relatedness density measures the sum of technologies related to a reference technology present in a given region. The implicit assumption in here is that technologies are linked through linear combinations, and those combinations predict the likelihood of successful diversification. However, relatedness density is often interpreted as a value that quantifies the existing requirements a region has relative to a technology, whereas the sum of existing related technologies do not inform us on the actual requirements.\nIn summary, relatedness and relatedness density measures suffer from diverse methodological issues embedded in the implicit assumptions in their core constructs. Co-occurrence and linear aggregation of observed frequency are misinterpreted, accrues information loss, and poorly handles the granular data often used. This means that the empirical and methodological work ahead must account for these issues to further contextualise the study of diversification strategies.\n\n\n1.2.3 Research problem\nIn the light of all the mentioned in this section, we fall back again on the core idea that we started this text with; How can we contextualise diversification strategies? The answer to this question is multi-layered and complex. In this section we started by outlining the importance of diversification strategies for regions into new technologies via patenting activities. We explained that the REC literature provides interesting methodological and conceptual framework of analysis and showed that despite their usefulness they suffer from structural issues that limit the advantages of the used granular data, thus limit the incorporation of a broader context empirically. Essentially, the research problem we focus on here, is both methodological and empirical in nature. We highlighted the structural methodological issues as the research gap which will be the focus of our methodological and empirical contribution.\nTo address the methodological gaps in REC, we propose a multilayered contextual framework that distinguishes between different contextual factors. Relatedness measures alone conflate these dimensions. By decomposing context into endogenous technology-region fit and exogenous environmental conditions, we can identify which combinations enable successful diversification across different regional contexts, following this design:\nEndogenous factors (within-region characteristics):\n\nTechnology-specific attributes (network position, centrality, embeddedness)\nRegional knowledge infrastructure (coherence between technology relationships and regional specialization patterns)\nRegional technological volume (number of patents in a specific technology)\n\nExogenous factors (beyond-region influences):\n\nNational entrepreneurial ecosystem characteristics (institutions, financing, R&D culture)\nSpatial spillovers from neighbouring regions (outcome diffusion, knowledge flows)\nGeographic proximity to coherent knowledge clusters\n\nThe interaction between these layers is critical: endogenous capacity determines what a region can develop, while exogenous context shapes realisation possibilities. For instance, a technology may align with regional knowledge infrastructure (endogenous coherence), but without supportive national institutions or proximity to innovative neighbours (exogenous support), entry probability remains low.\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize':'14px'}}}%%\ngraph TB\n    world[the world&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty shocks]\n    relevance[The need for resilience]\n    capacity[local capacity&lt;br/&gt;shock absorption]\n    change[change &&lt;br/&gt;adaptation]\n    innovation[Innovation]\n    combine[Combine existing&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in new&lt;br/&gt;configurations to&lt;br/&gt;create new knowledge]\n    \n    diversification[Diversification / variety]\n    relatedness[Geography&lt;br/&gt;of innovation:&lt;br/&gt;Relatedness]\n    whyrel[Why?&lt;br/&gt;• reliable framework to model tech relations&lt;br/&gt;• relations between regions & technologies]\n    \n    footprint[Footprint of&lt;br/&gt;tacit knowledge]\n    local[Local&lt;br/&gt;space-dependent]\n    products[patents & technologies]\n    focusregions[That's why we focus on&lt;br/&gt;patents-technologies in regions]\n    regionexist[regions exist in&lt;br/&gt;national + broader geographic contexts]\n    \n    cooccur[co-occurrence&lt;br/&gt;linear aggregates]\n    oneocc[naive&lt;br/&gt;assumptions]\n    twoocc[lose&lt;br/&gt;granular information]\n    suffer[Suffers from&lt;br/&gt;structural&lt;br/&gt;methodological issues]\n    loss[loss of context&lt;br/&gt;when measuring relationships]\n    \n    thesis[That's why the thesis focuses on studying how regions can diversify&lt;br/&gt;their technological profiles by leveraging granular data that relaxes&lt;br/&gt;relatedness assumptions and accounts for broader exogenous contexts]\n    contrib[methodological contribution: relatedness&lt;br/&gt;empirical contribution: exogenous contexts]\n    \n    world --&gt; relevance\n    relevance --&gt; capacity\n    relevance --&gt; change\n    change --&gt; innovation\n    capacity --&gt; innovation\n    innovation --&gt;|how?| combine\n    relevance --&gt; diversification\n    diversification --&gt; relatedness\n    whyrel --&gt; relatedness\n    \n    combine --&gt; footprint\n    footprint --&gt; local\n    local --&gt; products\n    products --&gt; focusregions\n    focusregions --&gt; regionexist\n    \n    relatedness --&gt; suffer\n    suffer --&gt; cooccur\n    cooccur --&gt; oneocc\n    cooccur --&gt; twoocc\n    twoocc --&gt; loss\n    oneocc --&gt; loss\n    \n    loss --&gt; thesis\n    suffer --&gt; thesis\n    regionexist --&gt; thesis\n    regionexist -.-&gt;|exogenous factors:&lt;br/&gt;• neighbouring regions characteristics & outcomes&lt;br/&gt;• national entrepreneurial ecosystem characteristics| thesis\n    thesis --&gt; contrib\n    \n    classDef boxStyle fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef ovalStyle fill:#fff4e6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class combine,whyrel,focusregions,loss,thesis,contrib boxStyle\n    class world,relevance,capacity,change,innovation,diversification,relatedness,footprint,local,products,regionexist,cooccur,oneocc,twoocc,suffer ovalStyle",

    "text": "3.1 Methodological Motivation\nTraditional relatedness frameworks model diversification through symmetric co-occurrence matrices and linear aggregation of relatedness density (Hausmann and Hidalgo 2011). However, as established in our problem statement, these constructs suffer from three structural limitations: (1) symmetry assumptions that obscure directional dependencies between technologies, (2) linear aggregation that loses granular information about technology-specific requirements, and (3) noise when technologies outnumber regions.\nWe address these limitations by replacing traditional measures with a machine learning training strategy based on the Random Forest algorithm (RF). Specifically, we use RF to generate: (1) Feature Importance Technology Space (FITS) follwoing Fessina et al. (2024), analogous to the mainstream Technology Space. FITS captures directional, hierarchical technology relationships, replacing symmetric relatedness measures; and (2) predicted probabilities (technological potential) following Albora et al. (2023), analogous to relatedness density. The technological potential estimates region-specific feasibility of technology adoption given the region’s own technological portfolio, replacing linear relatedness density. This approach enables the contextualization of diversification strategies by accounting simultaneously for technology-specific characteristics, regional knowledge infrastructure, and the broader non-linear interconnectedness between regions and technologies that traditional measures cannot adequately capture.\nBefore detailing our methodology and how we leverage the contributions in Fessina et al. (2024) and Albora et al. (2023), we will briefly situate this approach within the literature namely The Relatedness and Economic Complexity (REC). Essentially, REC formalizes the empirical observation that shared input requirements (knowledge, resources, capabilities) determine diversification feasibility (Hidalgo et al. 2018; Hidalgo 2021). Economic Complexity (EC) complements this by quantifying sophistication patterns (Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009). While this framework have proven valuable for policy (Zaccaria et al. 2018; E and A 2021), deriving granular, context-specific implications remains challenging (Hidalgo 2023; Li and Neffke 2024). Recent work on unrelated diversification (Flávio L. Pinheiro et al. 2022; Boschma et al. 2023), geographic inequalities (Flavio L. Pinheiro et al. 2025; Hartmann et al. 2017), and emerging technologies (Lee et al. 2018; Fessina et al. 2024) highlights the need for methodologies that capture contextual nuances beyond path dependency identification.\nOur approach responds to this need by modeling technology relationships and regional capabilities in ways that explicitly incorporate heterogeneity. The following sections establish our notation system, describe the Random Forest algorithm we use to our aim, and detail how we construct and interpret technological potential, FITS, and coherence measures.",

Although originally designed for trade data, this metric has been widely adopted in innovation geography literature. Following P.-A.

The RTA measures relative specialization, enabling simultaneous capture of expertise depth and portfolio diversity. Despite critiques regarding patent-based applications (P.

We focus on binary classification where \\(y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\).\nRandom Forest constructs an ensemble of \\(B\\) decision trees through bootstrap aggregating (bagging) with random feature subsampling. Each tree \\(T_b\\) is built on a bootstrap sample \\(\\mathcal{D}_b^*\\) drawn with replacement from the original dataset.\nEach tree recursively partitions the feature space through binary splits. At node \\(t\\), we randomly select \\(m\\) features (typically \\(m = \\sqrt{p}\\)) and evaluate all possible splits within this subset. For feature \\(j\\) and threshold \\(\\tau\\), the split creates two child nodes: \\(t_L = \\{i : x_{ij} \\leq \\tau\\}\\) and \\(t_R = \\{i : x_{ij} &gt; \\tau\\}\\).\nSplit quality is assessed via Gini impurity:\n\\[G(t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{1} p_k^2(t) = 2p_0(t)p_1(t)\\]\nwhere \\(p_k(t) = n_k(t)/n(t)\\) represents the proportion of class \\(k\\) observations at node \\(t\\). Gini impurity quantifies node heterogeneity: \\(G=0\\) indicates perfect purity (homogeneous class), while \\(G=0.5\\) indicates maximum impurity (equal class distribution). The optimal split maximizes weighted impurity reduction:\n\\[\\Delta G(j, \\tau) = G(t) - \\left[\\frac{n(t_L)}{n(t)} G(t_L) + \\frac{n(t_R)}{n(t)} G(t_R)\\right]\\]\nWeighting by relative node size prevents trivial splits that isolate single observations into pure but uninformative leaves.\nRecursive splitting continues until predefined stopping criteria: node purity (\\(G=0\\)), minimum node size threshold, or maximum tree depth. Terminal nodes are assigned the majority class of their constituent observations.\nFor prediction, observation \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) traverses all \\(B\\) trees. Final classification aggregates individual tree predictions via majority voting:\n\\[\\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{mode}\\{\\hat{y}_1(\\mathbf{x}), \\ldots, \\hat{y}_B(\\mathbf{x})\\}\\]\nClass probabilities are estimated as the proportion of trees predicting each class:\n\\[\\hat{P}(y=1|\\mathbf{x}) = B^{-1}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbb{I}[\\hat{y}_b(\\mathbf{x})=1]\\]\nThis probability represents empirical vote share across trees. Values near 1 indicate strong consensus for class 1 (high confidence), while values near 0.5 reflect uncertainty. Unlike parametric models, these are data-driven vote proportions rather than model-based probability estimates.\nThe algorithm’s effectiveness stems from variance reduction through decorrelated predictions. Bootstrap sampling and random feature selection reduce inter-tree correlation \\(\\rho\\), yielding ensemble variance:\n\\[\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\rho\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1-\\rho}{B}\\sigma^2\\]\nAs \\(B\\) increases and \\(\\rho\\) decreases, ensemble variance diminishes while maintaining the low bias of flexible tree models.\nFeature importance quantifies each predictor’s contribution by aggregating Gini impurity reductions:\n\\[I(j) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{t \\in T_b : v(t)=j} \\Delta G(t)\\]\nwhere the sum runs over all nodes using feature \\(j\\) for splitting. Higher values indicate features consistently creating purer partitions. Feature importance measures predictive association rather than causal effect, and suffers from bias toward high-cardinality features and correlated predictor sets. It ranks predictive relevance but requires caution in causal interpretation.",

    "text": "3.5 Connecting Random Forest to the Relatedness Framework\nWe apply Random Forest in two complementary ways that replace traditional relatedness constructs:\nA. Technological Potential estimates \\(p_{r,t,y}\\) = probability of future specialization in technology \\(t\\) for region \\(r\\). This replaces relatedness density—instead of linearly aggregating symmetric co-occurrence frequencies, we predict region-specific feasibility using past technology portfolios. This captures non-linear interactions and regional heterogeneity that linear measures miss.\nB. Feature Importance Technology Space (FITS) extracts \\(I_{t \\to t'}\\) = directional dependencies between technologies. This replaces symmetric relatedness—instead of co-occurrence frequencies, we identify which technologies predict others’ future adoption. Asymmetry reveals hierarchical structures: if \\(I_{t \\to t'} \\gg I_{t' \\to t}\\), technology \\(t\\) is a prerequisite or “stepping stone” toward \\(t'\\).\nTogether, these measures enable contextualized diversification analysis: FITS reveals technology-level hierarchies, Potential quantifies region-specific feasibility, and their combination allows testing how regional infrastructure, national ecosystems, and spatial factors moderate technology adoption patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    A[Input: RCA values&lt;br/&gt;for all technologies&lt;br/&gt;except target] --&gt; B[Tree 1]\n    A --&gt; C[Tree 2]\n    A --&gt; D[Tree 3]\n    A --&gt; E[...]\n    A --&gt; F[Tree B]\n    \n    B --&gt; G[Vote: 1]\n    C --&gt; H[Vote: 0]\n    D --&gt; I[Vote: 1]\n    E --&gt; J[Vote: 1]\n    F --&gt; K[Vote: 1]\n    \n    G --&gt; L[Aggregate Votes]\n    H --&gt; L\n    I --&gt; L\n    J --&gt; L\n    K --&gt; L\n    \n    L --&gt; M[Probability = 4/5 = 0.80&lt;br/&gt;Region will specialize&lt;br/&gt;in target technology]\n    \n    style A fill:#e1f5ff\n    style M fill:#ffe1e1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe follow the methodology of Fessina et al. (2024) and Albora et al. (2023), originally developed for trade data. The innovation lies in modeling each technology separately rather than constructing a single global model. For every technology \\(i \\in \\mathcal{T}\\), we train a binary classification model where:\n\nOutcome: \\(z_{r,i,y}\\) (whether region \\(r\\) specializes in technology \\(i\\) at year \\(y\\))\nFeatures: \\(\\{\\text{RTA}_{r,t,y-\\delta} : t \\in \\mathcal{T}, t \\neq i\\}\\) (RTA values for all other technologies \\(\\delta\\) years prior)\n\nThis technology-specific approach enables each model to learn unique dependency patterns. Setting \\(\\delta = 4\\) years balances predictive performance with data availability such that current capacity predict future ones (Andreoni and Chang 2019).\n\n3.5.1 Training Procedure\nWe predict specialization for target years \\(y_t \\in \\{2008, \\ldots, 2018\\}\\) using data from 1978 onward. For each target year \\(y_t\\) and technology \\(i\\):\nTraining set: \\[\nX_{\\text{train}} = \\{ \\text{RTA}_{r,t,y} \\mid y \\in [1978, y_t - 2\\delta], t \\neq i\\}\n\\] \\[\nY_{\\text{train}} = \\{z_{r,i,y} \\mid y \\in [1978 + \\delta,  y_t - \\delta]\\}\n\\]\nTest set: \\[\nX_{\\text{test}} = \\{ \\text{RTA}_{r,t,y_t-\\delta} \\mid t \\neq i\\}\n\\] \\[\nY_{\\text{test}} = \\{z_{r,i,y_t}\\}\n\\]\nThis produces 7,051 models (641 technologies × 11 years). Given computational constraints, we performed cross-validation on a random sample of four technologies (G06G, B67B, D02J, C08J) and applied the most frequent optimal parameters across all models: mtry = 139, trees = 100, min_n = 38. Training was conducted in R using the Ranger package (Wright and Ziegler 2017), orchestrated via the targets pipeline (Landau 2021) within the tidymodels framework.",

    "text": "3.7 Feature Importance Technology Space (FITS)\nTraditional technology networks use patent citations or co-occurrence patterns. Citations suffer from three limitations: (1) examiner-added citations may not reflect actual knowledge flows, (2) aggregating patent-level citations to technology-level relationships obscures directionality, and (3) citation networks are backward-looking rather than predictive (Fessina et al. 2024). Co-occurrence networks face the issues outlined in our problem statement: symmetry, noise, and linear assumptions.\nFITS addresses these limitations by constructing asymmetric, predictive networks from machine learning. Rather than inferring relationships from co-occurrence, FITS extracts directional dependencies from the feature importance scores of our Technological Potential models.\n\n3.7.1 FITS Construction\nRecall that for each technology \\(i\\), we trained a Random Forest model predicting \\(z_{r,i,y}\\) using \\(\\{\\text{RTA}_{r,t,y-\\delta} : t \\neq i\\}\\) as features. The feature importance \\(I_i(t)\\) quantifies how much technology \\(t\\) contributes to predicting future specialization in technology \\(i\\) across all regions and time periods in the training data.\nWe formalize FITS as a directed, weighted network \\(G = (V, E, W)\\) where:\n\nNodes \\(V = \\mathcal{T}\\): the set of technologies\nEdges \\(E\\): directed connections \\((t \\to i)\\) for all \\(t, i \\in \\mathcal{T}, t \\neq i\\)\nWeights \\(W_{t \\to i} = I_i(t)\\): feature importance of technology \\(t\\) in model predicting technology \\(i\\)\n\nWe normalize weights within each target technology’s model:\n\\[\nW_{t \\to i} = \\frac{I_i(t)}{\\sum_{t' \\neq i} I_i(t')}\n\\]\nensuring that for each technology \\(i\\), incoming edge weights sum to 1: \\(\\sum_{t \\neq i} W_{t \\to i} = 1\\).\n\n\n3.7.2 Mathematical Formulation\nFrom the Random Forest algorithm, feature importance for technology \\(t\\) in model \\(M_i\\) (predicting technology \\(i\\)) is:\n\\[\nI_i(t) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{n \\in T_b : v(n)=t} \\Delta G(n)\n\\]\nwhere the sum runs over all nodes \\(n\\) in all trees \\(T_b\\) that split on feature \\(t\\), and \\(\\Delta G(n)\\) is the Gini impurity reduction at node \\(n\\). Technologies that consistently create purer partitions when predicting \\(i\\) receive higher importance scores.\nThe full FITS network aggregates these relationships across all 641 technologies, producing a \\(641 \\times 641\\) weighted adjacency matrix (excluding self-loops).\n\n\n3.7.3 Asymmetry and Hierarchy\nCrucially, FITS is asymmetric: \\(W_{t \\to i} \\neq W_{i \\to t}\\) in general. This asymmetry captures hierarchical technological dependencies:\n\nIf \\(W_{t \\to i} \\gg W_{i \\to t}\\), technology \\(t\\) is a prerequisite or stepping stone toward \\(i\\) (expertise in \\(t\\) predicts future \\(i\\), but not vice versa)\nIf \\(W_{t \\to i} \\approx W_{i \\to t}\\), technologies are complementary peers (mutual predictive relationships)\nIf \\(W_{t \\to i} \\ll W_{i \\to t}\\), technology \\(i\\) is a prerequisite toward \\(t\\)\n\nThis hierarchical structure is invisible to symmetric co-occurrence measures and reveals technological trajectories: regions can identify which current capabilities enable paths toward desired future technologies.\n\n\n3.7.4 Conceptual Interpretation\nFITS edges represent predictive dependencies based on historical diversification patterns across all European regions. A strong edge \\(t \\to i\\) indicates that regions with RTA in technology \\(t\\) at time \\(y-\\delta\\) frequently developed RTA in technology \\(i\\) by time \\(y\\), even after controlling for all other technologies. This is fundamentally different from co-occurrence (which measures simultaneous presence) or citations (which measure backward-looking knowledge flows).\n\n\n3.7.5 Empirical Implications\nFITS enables novel analyses of technological landscapes:\n\nPath identification: For a target technology \\(i\\), examine incoming edge weights to identify strong predictors (prerequisites)\nBranching points: High out-degree nodes represent foundational technologies enabling diverse future specializations\nCategory structure: Aggregating edges by IPC categories reveals cross-domain dependencies (e.g., mechanical engineering → electronics)\nRegional positioning: Comparing a region’s current portfolio against FITS edge patterns reveals strategic opportunities and gaps\n\nIn our empirical analysis, FITS allows testing whether technology-specific characteristics (position in the network hierarchy, in/out-degree patterns, category embeddings) moderate diversification outcomes—aspects traditional relatedness measures cannot capture.\n\n\n\nTechnology Network (based on 2018 patent data)\n\n\nThe figure displays the FITS network with nodes colored by IPC category, sized by total degree, and transparency reflecting eigenvector centrality. Labels appear for high-centrality technologies. The structure reveals dense within-category connections and sparse but critical between-category bridges.",

    "text": "3.8 Coherence: Bridging Technology Networks and Regional Portfolios\nFITS identifies technology-to-technology relationships. Technological Potential quantifies regional diversification feasibility. Coherence bridges these levels by measuring the alignment between a technology’s position in the FITS network and a region’s existing specialization structure. In a way coherence can be viewed as sector level relatedness density.\nConsider two regions, both lacking specialization in technology \\(i\\), both having similar potential \\(p_{r,i,y}\\). However, Region A specializes in technologies that are strong predictors of \\(i\\) (high incoming FITS edges), while Region B specializes in technologies unrelated to \\(i\\) in the network. Coherence captures this difference: Region A has high coherence with \\(i\\) (its portfolio aligns with \\(i\\)’s network prerequisites), while Region B has low coherence (misalignment).\nThis metric operationalizes the “knowledge coherence” and “cognitive proximity” concepts from innovation literature (Neffke, Henning, and Boschma 2011; Boschma 2015) using our directional network structure. It enables testing whether diversification success depends not just on potential (predicted feasibility) but on the structural fit between regional portfolios and technology network positions.\nFor each region \\(r\\), technology \\(i\\), and IPC category \\(c\\), we construct two embedding vectors capturing \\(i\\)’s directional network position and compare them to \\(r\\)’s average embeddings for technologies in category \\(c\\).\nTechnology embeddings (individual technology \\(i\\)):\n\nIncoming: \\(\\text{embcat\\_to}_{i,c} = \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in c} W_{t \\to i}}{|\\{t \\in c : W_{t \\to i} &gt; 0\\}|}\\) (average FITS weight from category \\(c\\) to technology \\(i\\))\nOutgoing: \\(\\text{embcat\\_from}_{i,c} = \\frac{\\sum_{t' \\in c} W_{i \\to t'}}{|\\{t' \\in c : W_{i \\to t'} &gt; 0\\}|}\\) (average FITS weight from technology \\(i\\) to category \\(c\\))\n\nRegional average embeddings (region \\(r\\), category \\(c\\)):\n\nIncoming: \\(\\overline{\\text{embcat\\_to}}_{r,c} = \\frac{1}{|S_{r,c}|}\\sum_{t \\in S_{r,c}} \\text{embcat\\_to}_{t,c}\\) where \\(S_{r,c} = \\{t \\in c : \\text{RTA}_{r,t,y} \\geq 1\\}\\)\nOutgoing: \\(\\overline{\\text{embcat\\_from}}_{r,c} = \\frac{1}{|S_{r,c}|}\\sum_{t \\in S_{r,c}} \\text{embcat\\_from}_{t,c}\\)\n\nCoherence is the cosine similarity between technology \\(i\\)’s directional embeddings and region \\(r\\)’s average directional embeddings for category \\(c\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coherence}_{r,i,c,y} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2}{||\\mathbf{v}_1|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{v}_2||}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{v}_1 = [\\text{embcat\\_to}_{i,c}, \\overline{\\text{embcat\\_to}}_{r,c}]\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{v}_2 = [\\text{embcat\\_from}_{i,c}, \\overline{\\text{embcat\\_from}}_{r,c}]\\)\n\nCoherence ranges from -1 to 1:\n\nHigh coherence (\\(\\approx 1\\)): Technology \\(i\\)’s FITS network position (both incoming and outgoing connections to category \\(c\\)) closely matches the average network position of technologies in which region \\(r\\) specializes within category \\(c\\). The region’s existing capabilities align with the structural prerequisites and consequences of technology \\(i\\).\nNeutral coherence (\\(\\approx 0\\)): Misalignment between technology \\(i\\)’s relational structure and regional specialization patterns.\nNegative coherence (\\(\\approx -1\\)): Technology \\(i\\)’s network position is opposite to the region’s specialization structure (e.g., \\(i\\) receives inputs from categories where the region sends outputs).\n\n\n3.8.1 Empirical Application\nCoherence serves two roles in our empirical analysis:\n\nInteraction with Potential: Test whether high potential translates to actual diversification only when coherence is also high (H2a: technology-specific characteristics moderated by regional knowledge coherence)\nRegional Infrastructure Measure: Aggregate coherence across a region’s non-specialized technologies indicates how well the regional portfolio is “positioned” in the FITS network for future diversification (captures knowledge infrastructure quality)\n\nBy incorporating coherence, we test whether successful diversification requires not just predicted feasibility (potential) and related capabilities (traditional relatedness), but also structural alignment between regional portfolios and network prerequisites—a form of contextualization that traditional measures cannot capture.",
