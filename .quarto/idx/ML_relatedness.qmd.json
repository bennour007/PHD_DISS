For binary classification where $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, each tree $T_b$ is built on a bootstrap sample $\\mathcal{D}_b^*$ drawn with replacement from the original dataset.\n\n**Tree Construction via Recursive Partitioning**\n\nEach tree recursively partitions the feature space through binary splits. At node $t$, we randomly select $m$ features (typically $m = \\sqrt{p}$) and evaluate all possible splits within this subset. For feature $j$ and threshold $\\tau$, the split creates two child nodes: $t_L = \\{i : x_{ij} \\leq \\tau\\}$ and $t_R = \\{i : x_{ij} > \\tau\\}$.\n\n**Gini Impurity as Split Criterion**\n\nSplit quality is assessed via Gini impurity, defined as:\n\n$$G(t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{1} p_k^2(t) = 2p_0(t)p_1(t)$$\n\nwhere $p_k(t) = n_k(t)/n(t)$ represents the proportion of class $k$ observations at node $t$. Gini impurity quantifies node heterogeneity: $G=0$ indicates perfect purity (homogeneous class), while $G=0.5$ indicates maximum impurity (equal class distribution). The optimal split maximizes the weighted impurity reduction:\n\n$$\\Delta G(j, \\tau) = G(t) - \\left[\\frac{n(t_L)}{n(t)} G(t_L) + \\frac{n(t_R)}{n(t)} G(t_R)\\right]$$\n\nThe weighting by relative node size prevents trivial splits that isolate single observations into pure but uninformative leaves.\n\n**Termination and Class Assignment**\n\nRecursive splitting continues until predefined stopping criteria are met: node purity ($G=0$), minimum node size threshold, or maximum tree depth. Terminal nodes are assigned the majority class of their constituent observations.\n\n**Ensemble Prediction**\n\nFor prediction, observation $\\mathbf{x}$ traverses all $B$ trees. The final classification aggregates individual tree predictions via majority voting:\n\n$$\\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{mode}\\{\\hat{y}_1(\\mathbf{x}), \\ldots, \\hat{y}_B(\\mathbf{x})\\}$$\n\nClass probabilities are estimated as the proportion of trees predicting each class: \n\n$$\\hat{P}(y=1|\\mathbf{x}) = B^{-1}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbb{I}[\\hat{y}_b(\\mathbf{x})=1]$$\n\n**Interpreting Probability Estimates**\n\nThis probability represents the empirical vote share across trees. Values near 1 indicate strong consensus for class 1 (high confidence), while values near 0.5 reflect uncertainty with divided predictions. Unlike parametric models, these are purely data-driven vote proportions rather than model-based probability estimates. Practitioners can adjust classification thresholds based on asymmetric misclassification costs.\n\n**Variance Reduction Mechanism**\n\nThe algorithm's effectiveness stems from variance reduction through decorrelated predictions. Bootstrap sampling and random feature selection reduce inter-tree correlation $\\rho$, yielding ensemble variance:\n\n$$\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\rho\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1-\\rho}{B}\\sigma^2$$\n\nAs $B$ increases and $\\rho$ decreases, ensemble variance diminishes while maintaining the low bias of flexible tree models.\n\n**Feature Importance**\n\nFeature importance quantifies each predictor's contribution by aggregating Gini impurity reductions:\n\n$$I(j) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{t \\in T_b : v(t)=j} \\Delta G(t)$$\n\nwhere the sum runs over all nodes using feature $j$ for splitting. Higher values indicate features consistently creating purer partitions. However, importance measures predictive association rather than causal effect, and suffer from bias toward high-cardinality features and correlated predictor sets. They serve to rank predictive relevance but require caution in causal interpretation.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"ML_relatedness.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
