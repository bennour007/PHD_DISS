**Abstract** 

In this paper we investigate how collaboration context moderates the relationship between patent portfolio characteristics and patent value in European innovation ecosystems. Treating patents as portfolios of technologies positioned within a knowledge network, we differentiate between technological value (measured by forward citations) and commercial value (measured by renewal years). Using the Feature Importance Product Space approach, we construct an asymmetric directed network of technology relationships based on IPC classifications. Our econometric analysis reveals that the influence of technology network positions on patent value varies significantly across regional, national, and international collaboration contexts, with each responding through distinct mechanisms to commercial and technological value.

## Introduction

Patenting activities, are often considered as a proxy to the innovative process [@acs2002patents]. A process in which economic actors leverage different knowledge areas and resources to produce an innovative output. This process, however, is not done in isolation, since innovation relies on already existing knowledge, combining different technologies in novel configurations[@jaffe2019patent; @sonmez2018interregional]. This  combinatorial nature of knowledge is often space-dependent. Meaning that the geography where knowledge exists is an important factor in the innovative process. Inventors understand these geographical and combinatorial constraints, and often mitigate them through collaboration [@doloreux2015collaboration]. But how do we assess the value of this process? are all innovative processes possess similar value? if not, what characteristics of the process drives this value?  

The value of a patent has been studied in the literature from different perspectives.  For instance the renewal of patent's intellectual rights reflects its implied commercial value [@harhoff1999citation; @bessen2008value; @svensson2022patent]. Alternatively, forward citations are considered as a relatively more direct measure of technological recognition as argued in [@sonmez2018interregional]. [@petruzzelli2015determinants; @liu2014human; @bessen2008value], among others, show that patents with significant technological contributions are cited more frequently. Furthermore, the characteristics of patents has also been considered in different studies. [@sonmez2018interregional; @belderbos2014co; @agostini2015r; @crescenzi2016inventors; @ascani2020global], among others, consider the IPC classifications at the fourth digit as unique technologies and leverage this classification to determine the diversity of knowledge contained in a patent as an explanatory factor. Other studies, such as [@jeon2019multiple], use  association rule mining (ARM) on IPC classes at the third digits to construct a network of technologies and use their metrics to assess the characteristics identifying safety technologies. [@oh2017analysis] measure similarity of cited patents to extract network metrics to determine the characteristics of trending technologies. 

In this study, we consider a different view of patenting activities. Each patent contains a portfolio of technologies, and these technologies occupy specific positions in the network of technological relationships: some are central and prestigious, others bridge distant domains, while others are specialized within narrow fields. In this context, existing research has treated collaboration and technology network position as separate factors on patent value. Which leaves the gap open for a fundamental question: Does the value of a patent depend on its network position? and at which collaborative context this dependence is moderated? 


Because knowledge and its application context are spatially bounded [@ascani2020global; @balland2017geography]. We expect different dynamics driving technological and commercial value at different collaboration contexts. Thus, in this paper, we argue that collaboration determines the type and strength of the network positions that drives patent's value. To test this, we consider patents as portfolios of technologies. Following literature, we rely on data from the European Patents Office and consider IPC classifications at the forth digit as standalone technologies. Following [@svensson2022patent; @sonmez2018interregional], we differentiate between two types of value, technological value proxied by the number of forward citations in the last 7 years, and commercial value proxied by the renewal years for each patent. 

To construct the relationships between technologies, we rely on a novel methodology based on tree algorithms, namely the Feature Importance Product Space [@fessina2024identifying] which enables us to construct an asymmetric directed network. Then we aggregate the network metrics of the technologies in each patent's portfolio to summarise its aggregate position in the network. We then proceed with a regression analysis to assess the portfolio's influence on technological and commercial value of each patent and the moderating effect of collaboration.

The remainder of this paper is divided as follows: section 2 will introduce the data and the methodological approach we adopted, section 3 presents the results of our econometric analysis and finally section 4 will discuss these results and conclude.






## Data and Methods

We use Data from the European Patents Office, which contains details on the Patents applications from 1978 to 2021. The EPO provides rigorous and detailed classification of each patent application up to a 8 or more digits, in our case we consider the IPC classifications but since these classifications are extremely granular and are considerably larger then the regions observed (at 8000+ class), we limit our data to the 4th digit of the IPC classification. These 4 digits contain 3 layers of information with which we can define a given technology, a section denoted by a letter, a class denoted by two digits, and a subclass denoted by another letter. Thus, An IPC class/technology such as F16H is structured hierarchically: Section F(we refer to in the next sections as category) covers Mechanical engineering (including lighting, heating, weapons, and blasting), Class 16 pertains to engineering elements and general methods for producing and transmitting mechanical power, and Subclass H specifically addresses gears, shaft-connections, and gearing for conveying rotary motion. With such a subset we ended up with 641 distinct technologies. Additionally the same data also provides details on where the application were made, we capture these details at the NUTS2 level. 

### Feature Importance Technolgy Space

A natural approach to constructing technology networks would be to use patent citation data: if Patent A cites Patent B, and they contain different technologies, this reveals a relationship between those technology domains. However, this approach presents three critical limitations for our purposes. First, EPO citations include examiner-added citations that may not reflect actual knowledge flows between inventors. Second, aggregating patent-level citations to technology-level relationships relies on co-occurrence patterns that obscure the directionality of knowledge dependencies—whether technology A enables B or vice versa. Third, citation networks are inherently backward-looking, reflecting past relationships rather than predicting future technological trajectories.

To address these limitations, we adopt the Feature Importance Product Space (FIPS) methodology [@fessina2024identifying]. Rather than inferring relationships from citation co-occurrence, FIPS uses machine learning to identify which existing technology specializations predict future specialization in other technologies. Specifically, we train random forest models where the current presence of regional expertise in technology T is predicted by past expertise patterns across all other technologies. The resulting feature importance scores reveal directional, predictive relationships: if expertise in technology A strongly predicts future expertise in B, this indicates A is a "stepping stone" toward B, even if the reverse is not true. This asymmetric structure captures hierarchical technological dependencies that symmetric co-occurrence measures would miss, and its forward-looking nature aligns with our focus on how current network positions influence future patent value.

Following [@fessina2024identifying], we quantify specialization patterns by means of the Revealed Comparative Advantage(RCA) [@balassa1965rca]. Although the RCA is mainly designed for use with international trade data, it has also been adopted in the literature of the geography of innovation following the Balland nomenclature [@balland2017geography] we will refer to this metric as the Revealed Technological Advantage(RTA) instead. The RTA measures a location's relative specialization level in a given technology which enables us to capture both expertise and diversity when we aggregate all the technologies for each location. This measure, proved useful in determining complex and non-linear relationships between products/activities. Simply put, the RTA quantifies simultaneously the relative level and the quality of co-occurrence, which reduces the noise in the network data. Although some papers criticise the use of the RCA/RTA with patents classes [pinheiro2025], we think it fits our objective in capturing meaningful relationships between technologies when we use them in the framework of [@fessina2024identifying]. We compute these measures to obtain for each year a matrix denoting the regions in its rows and the technologies in its columns. We formalize it as follows: Let $X_{r,t,y}$ be the measure of activity (patent counts) of region $r$ in technology $t$ during year $y$. Where $\mathcal{T}$ is the set of technologies, $\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of years, and $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of regions.

$$
\mathcal{T} = \{\,t : 1 \le t \le N_T\},\quad
\mathcal{Y} = \{\,y : 1 \le y \le N_Y\},\quad
\mathcal{R} = \{\,r : 1 \le r \le N_R\}.
$$

And $N_T, N_Y, N_R$ are the total counts of technologies, years, regions and countries.



The RTA of region $r$ in technology $t$ in year $y$ is given by:

$$
\mathrm{RTA}_{r,t,y}
= \frac{\displaystyle\frac{X_{r,t,y}}{\sum_{t'} X_{r,t',y}}}
       {\displaystyle\frac{\sum_{r'} X_{r',t,y}}{\sum_{r',t'} X_{r',t',y}}}
= \frac{X_{r,t,y}\,\sum_{r',t'}X_{r',t',y}}
       {\bigl(\sum_{t'}X_{r,t',y}\bigr)\,\bigl(\sum_{r'}X_{r',t,y}\bigr)}
$$

Moving forward, we use these matrices stratified by year (application year) to train the random forest models following the same strategy in [@albora2023product]. Essentially the novelty in this approach is to train a single model for each of the technologies we have. The idea is that each model will use the RTA values of all t-1 technologies observed to predict the outcome of a single technology, the target of the model. Formally the predicted outcome is as follows:

$$
Y_{r,t,y}
\;=\;
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }\mathrm{RTA}_{r,t,y}\ge1,\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

The $Y_{r,t,y}$ term reflects the specialisation of region $r$ at year $y$ in technology $t$. Additionally we include a 4 year lag, or a fixed horizon we call delta where $\delta=4$ in the features since the entire idea is to assess the capacity of the current outcomes based on the past features. This aligns with instincts in the literature in which studies like [@andreoni2019political] posit that past capacities predict future diversification. Eventually the predicted outcomes describe what technology is possible to develop expertise in, given the observed capacity $\delta$ years ago. The extension we propose in this paper, that was not originally proposed in  [@albora2023product] nor in [@fessina2024identifying], is that we leverage the data to have predictions for different target years rather than just one. 


To execute the modeling strategy we build the training and testing sets consequently: For year $y = y_i...y_f$, where $y_i = 1978$ and $y_f = 2018$, we consider the target years of prediction $y_t \in \{2008,..., 2018\}$. We then form the data subsets to predict $Y_{r,t,y}$ for the target prediction years $y_t$ as follows:

$$
X_{\text{train}} = \{ \mathrm{RTA}_{r,t,y} | y \in [y_0, y_t - 2\delta]\},\quad Y_{\text{train}} = {z}_{r,t',y} | y \in [y_0 + \delta,  y_t - \delta] \}
$$ $$
X_{\text{test}} =  \{ \mathrm{RTA}_{r,t,y} |y_t - \delta\},\quad 
Y_{\text{test}} = \{ z_{r,t,y} |y_t\}
$$

Once we train our models, one for each technology for each of the 11 years (7051 models in total) we obtain at each year, and for each technology, the probability that a region develops expertise. The Gini impurity feature importance reveal the relative importance of each technology in predicting the outcome. Thus for each model, we obtain a vector of importance which we z-standardise and when we combine all these vectors we construct an adjacency matrix that describes the weights and direction of links for each of the technologies pairs we have. Essentially we end up with 11 matrices for each of the target years. This approach is an adaptation to the Feature Importance Product Space to our context and provide a similar information barring the validation of these features importance vectors. Our approach also extends this methodology by incorporating prediction for different target years instead for only one. However, we note that statistical validation of the feature importance vectors increases the training time exponentially^[In the original paper, the authors reported that the models "required approximately 180 hours on a server with 20 cores"]. For the purposes of this study we decided filter for the top 25% of the incoming and outgoing edges to avoid that burden, We discuss further possible alternatives and improvements in the last section. 

Feature Importance Product Space is natural extension of the Product Progression methodology approach [@albora2023product]. Despite the marginal differences in the granular data used, both approaches provide a holistic non-linear estimation for the relationship between activities that are derived from geographic agglomeration of technological expertise. Which satisfies the consensus in the geography of innovation literature that knowledge is location-dependent, while simultaneously mitigating the issues arising from networks of co-occurrence and the linear combination of proximate knowledge. An example of the resulted network for the 2018 year is shown in Figure 1.

-->

From this point, we can calculate the technology level networks' metrics that informs about the general position in the network as a whole and within each own category. The variables we use are described^[we aggregate the metrics of each pattern with a weighted average based on the frequency of technologies in each portfolio since some patents use granular IPC classes of the same section/category, additionally we filter the data for patents with a portfolio of more that 6 technologies] in table 1, and we provide summary statistics in table 2. Further details on the metrics construction in the appendix.

Additionally, the EPO data contains information on the parties involved in a patent application. Thus we specify the patterns of collaboration variable based on the geography of these parties. This variable is categorical, with three distinct categories which we binarise in the regression models. If the applicant are all from the same region we consider the collaboration a regional one, if they are from the same country then a national one, and if the parties are from different countries we consider the collaboration is international. 

The variables we use in this paper essentially examine the network characteristics of the individual technologies. We chose these variables to reflect three important characteristics of individual technologies: foundational, bridging, and diversity characteristics. Foundational characteristics inform us on the general emededness of a technology, or in simpler terms how many important nodes it connects to. Eigenvector centrality is usually used for similar assessment, but given the bi-directional nature of the network, we chose to adopt the authority and hub scores instead. Both are similar to eigenvector centrality, but simply specify the direction of of the connection to important nodes. Authority of a technology tells us how many important nodes points to it, whereas the Hub score tells us how many important nodes a technology points to. Bridging characteristics inform us on the adaptability of a technology. A bridging technology is one that connects distant nodes and facilitate their access. Hence, we use betweenness centrality and closeness asymmetry metrics to assess this dimension. Betweenness centrality tells us the frequency a technology appear in a shortest path between the technology pairs in the network. Whereas closeness asymmetry tells us how balanced are the average shortest path distances from and to all nodes relative to a specific technology which informs on its accessibility. Additionally, to assess the diversity of a technology we adopt Shanon entropy measure on the total strength. This measures the evenness of the weighted degree distribution of a node and inform us whether a given node is strongly connected to some nodes compared to all connections, or is evenly connected. This tells us how much a node has special connections to others. Moreover, because technologies exist in a specific category(first digit of the IPC classification) we also use two other metrics to assess the embededness within own category versus influence on other categories. We construct these two metrics as ratios of the incoming and outgoing weighted edges. Details can be found in the appendix.

### Regression

We model forward citations^[The renewal years and the forward citations variables where used from the 2025 EPO database to respect the 7 years window from 2018] with a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) and renewal years with a negative binomial (NB) following similar approaches specifically [@hausman1984econometric; @branstetter2001knowledge]. We opted for the Negative Binomial models because in both cases the standard deviation is larger than the mean, moreover in the case of the citations model half of the observation have zero counts value which forced us to use a zero inflated negative binomial model eventually. Additionally we also tested the Poisson counts model with and without zero inflation, and conducted the dispersion and the Vuong tests [@vuong1989likelihood ; @cameron2013regression]. The comparison showed evidence that the Negative Binomial is the adequate choice. The explanatory variables undergo log-transformation followed by z-standardization within each application year to ensure comparability across time periods, while the citation count and renewal count outcome variables remains in their natural scale to preserve the count data structure with a log link for linear interpretation. The coefficients of both models are thus interpreted as elasticities for a one standard deviation increase in the percentage change of the independent variables.

## Results

**Regional collaboration** produces patents where foundational technologies with incoming connections from important nodes (authority +1.5%), easy reachability (closeness asymmetry +1.8%), and balanced network ties (strength entropy +8.7%) drive technological recognition through citations. For commercial value, patents' renewals are driven by technologies with strong authority (+1.8%) and balanced connections (strength entropy +0.9%), but inhibited by hub technologies (-2.3%) and those that are easily reachable (-0.6%). Regional collaboration rewards enabler foundational technologies and reachability in the network for technological recognition. Whereas commercial value in this context is driven by enabler foundational technologies and domain specialisation while inhibited by integrative technologies, network reachability and cross-domain connections.

**National collaboration** shows distinct drivers for each value dimension. Technological recognition rewards hub technologies (+7.3%), balanced connections (strength entropy +5.2%), and within-category specialization (+2.9%), while penalizing bridges (-11.9%). Commercial value rewards authority (+3.1%) and balanced connections (strength entropy +2.2%), but penalizes hubs (-3.9%). National collaboration rewards technologies where integrative characteristics and domain specialisation generate technological value, but commercially rewards enabling foundational technologies.

**International collaboration** reveals the strongest differentiation. Technological recognition rewards hubs (+13.0%), within-category specialization (+4.5%), cross-category connections (+5.8%), and modest connection balance (strength entropy +1.2%), while heavily penalizing bridges (-16.6%). Commercial value rewards balanced connections (strength entropy +2.1%) and marginally hubs (+2.1%), while penalizing bridges (-2.1%). International collaborations rewards technologies where both domain specialisation and cross-domain connection as well as integrative foundational features drive technological value, but commercial value is driven primarily by entropy of the connection strength of a technology. This means that commercially, technologies with even connection strengths to other technologies are the most important criteria for this context.

## Discussion and Conclusion

This paper started by acknowledging the premise that patenting activities can be considered as a proxy for innovation processes. These activities combine exiting technologies in different configuration to generate new knowledge. We extended this premise by arguing that the combinatorial constraints of existing knowledge can be bridged through collaboration which increases the knowledge pool. We hypothesised that collaboration moderate the influence of patent's portfolio characteristics on its technological and commercial value. Our results confirmed this hypothesis and revealed that this relationship is contingent on the collaboration context, though technological value (citations) and commercial value (renewals) respond through different mechanisms. Our findings provide a different approach to assessing patent value by considering the endogenous characteristics of the technologies for each patent. These results can guide policy makers to design instruments that capitalise on the strengths and weaknesses of innovation ecosystems at regional, national, and European levels.   

Our contribution in this paper is two folds. Empirically, we confirm our initial hypothesis that the collaboration patterns moderate the influence of technology characteristics on patent value and we show that this moderation is different for commercial and technological value. Whereas methodologically, we rely on an adaptation of the feature importance product space approach to estimate the bi-directional and asymmetric relationships between technologies to avoid the issues arising from co-occurrence and co-citations approaches. 

The results reported in this paper show that regional collaboration rewards enabler technologies and network reachability for citations, but commercial value is influenced only by enabler technologies with domain specialization, not integrative platforms or cross-domain connections—consistent with findings in [@gao2023knowledge; @qiu2017emerging] that local knowledge is most valuable for locally-rooted technologies. This pattern also reflects the observation in [@sonmez2018interregional] that organisational collaboration produces more economically valuable inventions when collaborating inventors are co-located, and that technologically similar inter-industry knowledge flows create greater economic value. Similarly, the results in  [@breschi2004knowledge] show that inventors linked by shorter social chains cite each other more explains why network reachability matters for technological recognition in regional contexts where social distance is minimal unlike the national and international collaboration contexts.

On the other hand, national collaboration extends this pattern: integrative technologies and domain specialists gain recognition, yet commercial value accrues only to enabler technologies with connection evenness. This aligns with [@singh2013geographic], where the authors observed that national borders constrain knowledge diffusion. [@sonmez2018interregional]  finds that interregional collaboration leads to more valuable patents when inventors share organizational affiliation. Which suggests that the citation premium for integrative technologies may reflect the output of ongoing ambitious projects unrelated to commercialisation objectives. 


Finally, international collaboration shows the most contrasting patterns: technological value strongly rewards integrative, domain-specialized, and cross-domain connected technologies, while commercial value depends almost exclusively on connection evenness, with bridging technologies penalized in both dimensions aligning with similar findings in [@qiu2017emerging; @wan2019dynamics]. Moreover, the results in [@ascani2020global] shows that regional specialization and global networks work synergistically, aligns with our results and explains why international collaboration rewards both domain specialization and cross-domain connections for recognition, yet commercial value requires the stable connection patterns that enable actual knowledge integration. 

While our approach offers important insights into the innovation ecosystem of European regions from a technology network perspective, several caveats are worth noting. First, our framework builds on machine learning–based relatedness modeling [@tacchella2023relatedness; @fessina2024identifying]. These methods originally capture relatedness through observed flows between products, whereas technology networks rely on co-occurrence and are not organically linked. Even patent citation networks are partly constructed, since they depend on examiner decisions [@hegde2009examiner]. Our methodological contribution builds on  [@breschi2004knowledge] assessment that knowledge flows follow a complex social chains that networks analysis and metrics are adequate to capture. Our adaptation of the FIPS approach extends this idea by leveraging asymmetric nature of the network we constructed.  
Additionally, unlike the original formulation, we omitted the statistical validation step for the feature importance for each model due to computational burden.  We justify our decision here by the results reported by [@fessina2024identifying] and [@albora2023product] where even with the default parameters, random forest is a better predictor of these relationships than RCA is. However, future work could address this issue using the approach in [@saracco2015randomizing]. Second, our econometric analysis relied on aggregated metrics at the patent level. While convenient, this weighted mean aggregation likely obscures some granular information. Structural equation modeling was not feasible given the complexity of our zero-inflated negative binomial framework, but a promising alternative would be to construct priors for the aggregated variables and pursue a Bayesian approach under similar assumptions.
