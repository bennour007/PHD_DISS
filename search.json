    "text": "1.1 General background\nThe Covid 19 pandemic showed structural challenges of national economies all over the world, specifically the fragility of neoliberal policies in times of crisis and the lack of industrial and economic resilience. Six years after the fact, our societies are now confronted with inevitable novel challenges and looming shocks. We are already witnessing the consequences of AI development as it paves the way for a new technological revolution that would render most local economies obsolete and cause massive unemployment in white collar sectors. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to be the end of the shocks the world has seen recently as the war in Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, and most importantly the current, chaotic trade wars, seem to foster ever increasing uncertainties. Facing all this, policy makers are confronted with a simple choice; strategise and plan for more resilient local economies. In different streams of literature, resilience is directly related to diversification/variety, whether in portfolio management in finance, trade partnerships/linkages, industrial activities, or in terms of knowledge as well. Thus we can equivalently say that resilience is the capacity to resist and/or adapt to external shocks by relying on exiting internal capabilities that evolve in the face of such shocks. This means that for an economy to survive uncertainties, it needs to evolve, change, and innovate its way to the other end of the bleak challenges it’s confronted with. However, to evolve, change and innovate, a baseline of knowledge should be leveraged since the consensus is that variety is a buffer against external shocks and shields uncertainties. This chain of thoughts, takes us back to the conceptual basics of sustainable economic development and growth; the knowledge fabric is what facilitate any long term strategy, and has been shown in the literature as clear catalyst for societal prosperity and economic resilience. For this reason the study of knowledge is detrimental for policy making, and understanding how to increase its diversity is more relevant than ever before.\nKnowledge is a set of information that covers one or many topics, and its characteristics are contingent on the different forms it can take or how it was created, generally speaking, academia and businesses are the main knowledge creators in any economy through research and patents. Essentially, knowledge can be codified (accessible by anyone through any medium), or tacit (personal information based on social connections, intuition, experience, etc, that’s hard to share with others). The consensus in the literature is that the main driver of competitive advantage for firms is the tacit form of knowledge, which is also widely acknowledged that it’s space dependent. However, the knowledge produced by firms can be reliably seen in patents, although they capture codified information, they also reveal tacit knowledge and its geographic footprint in space. This means that its detrimental to assess the knowledge in patenting activities (we refer to this knowledge as technologies), and more so to focus on the local aspect of these activities i.e: sub-national regions.\nThis framing, however, is not at all new or novel. In fact, this is the entire aim of the literature of the geography of innovation; to study how innovation is created and diffused to different actors in different geographical contexts. Specifically, relatedness and economic complexity (REC) is one of the main streams of literature that focus on the relationships between activities and geographies. The conceptual and methodological framework that REC provides is widely used and adopted in academia and among policy practitioners and was one of the main contributors to the smart specialisation policy literature. The ideas embedded in this framework, to put it simply, rely on the premise of spatial dependence of tacit knowledge in local/regional economies/geographies and focus on simplifying these relationships using network science to model the relationships between knowledge and regions. Albeit these simplifications provide valuable scope for analysis and interpretation, the cost from the loss of granular information implies that there’s much more conceptual, methodological, and empirical work needed. The reason for this is because the loss of information bias the empirical interpretation in the sense that we end up with a homogeneous implication with weak regards to the regional and national contexts as well as the technological characteristics. This work is motivated by this gap and aims to simply contextualise the study of knowledge diversification using the same granular information publicly available and commonly used in the REC literature. The idea is simple, account for endogenous and exogenous contexts using granular data and understand the contexts and contingencies that drives regional diversification.",

    "title": "1  Introduction",
    "section": "1.2 Problem statement",
    "text": "1.2 Problem statement\nThe main problem that this works aims to solve is directly embedded in the methodological and empirical framework of REC. REC models diversification through network aggregation based on co-location and co-occurrence patterns. Using these patterns, different aggregations are used to quantify relatedness (the frequency of observing a pair of activities in the same region), and relatedness density (how much of the activities frequently observed together a region has). However, these measures are often interpreted not as aggregations of frequent observations but rather as relationship models. Empirically, diversification is studied using these constructs as predictors of entry, that is a region’s entry to a new specialisation in a new technology, often considered as a binary outcome. In here we briefly outline the big picture in the REC methodological and empirical framework, its conceptual issues, its empirical consequences, and highlight the research gap.\n\n1.2.1 Relatedness, relatedness density, and diversification\nRelatedness and relatedness density are essentially measures of proximity. In a sense they describe how close two technologies are close to each other, or how close a given technology is to a region given its portfolio of technologies. To further decompose the problem here, we will first establish the methodological constructs for proximity measures. For relatedness that’s co-occurrence, and for relatedness density that’s the linear aggregation of relatedness.\nFirst, co-occurrence is essentially the frequency of observing two activities together. In the REC literature, this frequency describes the strength of the relationship. Activities frequently observed together are more related than the pairs rarely observed together.\nSecond, linear aggregation of relatedness essentially measures the percentage of co-located technologies in a region that are related to a reference technology. Thus, we can think about relatedness density as the link between related technologies and co-located technologies. The idea in the REC literature states that relative to a given technology, the more related technologies a region has, the more likely that it can develop that technology.\nThese two constructs are used together to predict the probability that a region will enter a new technology. The REC literature shows that relatedness density is consistently associated with higher probabilities in almost all studies. These results among others were one of the major latent contributors to smart specialisation strategy (S3) policy. Thus the consensus in the literature was clear: In order to diversify into new technologies with the highest likelihood of success, regions must prioritise investment in related technologies.\n\n\n1.2.2 Empirical consequences\nThe idea of resilience is not a main focus for the REC literature nor it is ours. However, falling back to this concept allows us to further assess the empirical consequences of the mainstream interpretation of relatedness and relatedness density. The idea is that in order to be resilient to external shocks and subsequent uncertainties diversification is key. But what kind of diversification is required and feasible and how to achieve it is the focus here. The REC literature tells us that the most likely successful diversification strategy is the one that targets related capacity in the regions, often referred to as related variety. However, generalising this recommendation is not that straight forward. Aggregate regional capacities and their national and broader geographic contexts differ significantly. The initial landscape of the regional technological portfolio is detrimental here because this strategy could favour regions with already diverse portfolio but it’s questionable that regions with limited portfolios would equally benefit. This is aligned with the concept of path dependency, related variety without context enforces that dependency and locks regions within their limited capacities. This brings us back to the core focus of in this work; context is key. However, context on its own here might not be enough since path dependency of related variety is a direct result of how relatedness and relatedness density is calculated and interpreted. The constructs that enable these measures (co-occurrence and linear aggregation) are the core problem that we’re highlighting here. The reason behind this specific focus relied on the implicit assumptions embedded in these methodological constructs.\nCo-occurrence assumes that technologies frequently observed together are likely related. Although this is within the boundaries of common sense, it’s highly unlikely that’s actually the case. A frequency measure is only informative when we have more observations than items—that is, more geographies than technologies. Almost always, we will have more technologies than geographies, this means that relatedness is at best noisy. Additionally, relatedness as interpreted in the literature quantifies the relationship between pairs of technologies. However, as it stands, there’s no differentiation in the direction of that relationship thus, assuming that the relationship between two technologies is symmetrical. Albeit this assumption in itself is not problematic, it exacerbates the linearity issue when we measure relatedness density as we loose information in co-occurrence, symmetry, and linear aggregations. This takes us to the final issue we would like to highlight; relatedness density. Simply put, relatedness density measures the sum of technologies related to a reference technology present in a given region. The implicit assumption in here is that technologies are linked through linear combinations, and those combinations predict the likelihood of successful diversification. However, relatedness density is often interpreted as a value that quantifies the existing requirements a region has relative to a technology, whereas the sum of existing related technologies do not inform us on the actual requirements.\nIn summary, relatedness and relatedness density measures suffer from diverse methodological issues embedded in the implicit assumptions in their core constructs. Co-occurrence and linear aggregation of observed frequency are misinterpreted, accrues information loss, and poorly handles the granular data often used. This means that the empirical and methodological work ahead must account for these issues to further contextualise the study of diversification strategies.\n\n\n1.2.3 Research problem\nIn the light of all the mentioned in this section, we fall back again on the core idea that we started this text with; How can we contextualise diversification strategies? The answer to this question is multi-layered and complex. In this section we started by outlining the importance of diversification strategies for regions into new technologies via patenting activities. We explained that the REC literature provides interesting methodological and conceptual framework of analysis and showed that despite their usefulness they suffer from structural issues that limit the advantages of the used granular data, thus limit the incorporation of a broader context empirically. Essentially, the research problem we focus on here, is both methodological and empirical in nature. We highlighted the structural methodological issues as the research gap which will be the focus of our methodological and empirical contribution.\nTo address the methodological gaps in REC, we propose a multilayered contextual framework that distinguishes between different contextual factors. Relatedness measures alone conflate these dimensions. By decomposing context into endogenous technology-region fit and exogenous environmental conditions, we can identify which combinations enable successful diversification across different regional contexts, following this design:\nEndogenous factors (within-region characteristics):\n\nTechnology-specific attributes (network position, centrality, embeddedness)\nRegional knowledge infrastructure (coherence between technology relationships and regional specialization patterns)\nRegional technological volume (number of patents in a specific technology)\n\nExogenous factors (beyond-region influences):\n\nNational entrepreneurial ecosystem characteristics (institutions, financing, R&D culture)\nSpatial spillovers from neighbouring regions (outcome diffusion, knowledge flows)\nGeographic proximity to coherent knowledge clusters\n\nThe interaction between these layers is critical: endogenous capacity determines what a region can develop, while exogenous context shapes realisation possibilities. For instance, a technology may align with regional knowledge infrastructure (endogenous coherence), but without supportive national institutions or proximity to innovative neighbours (exogenous support), entry probability remains low.\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize':'14px'}}}%%\ngraph TB\n    world[the world&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty shocks]\n    relevance[The need for resilience]\n    capacity[local capacity&lt;br/&gt;shock absorption]\n    change[change &&lt;br/&gt;adaptation]\n    innovation[Innovation]\n    combine[Combine existing&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in new&lt;br/&gt;configurations to&lt;br/&gt;create new knowledge]\n    \n    diversification[Diversification / variety]\n    relatedness[Geography&lt;br/&gt;of innovation:&lt;br/&gt;Relatedness]\n    whyrel[Why?&lt;br/&gt;• reliable framework to model tech relations&lt;br/&gt;• relations between regions & technologies]\n    \n    footprint[Footprint of&lt;br/&gt;tacit knowledge]\n    local[Local&lt;br/&gt;space-dependent]\n    products[patents & technologies]\n    focusregions[That's why we focus on&lt;br/&gt;patents-technologies in regions]\n    regionexist[regions exist in&lt;br/&gt;national + broader geographic contexts]\n    \n    cooccur[co-occurrence&lt;br/&gt;linear aggregates]\n    oneocc[naive&lt;br/&gt;assumptions]\n    twoocc[lose&lt;br/&gt;granular information]\n    suffer[Suffers from&lt;br/&gt;structural&lt;br/&gt;methodological issues]\n    loss[loss of context&lt;br/&gt;when measuring relationships]\n    \n    thesis[That's why the thesis focuses on studying how regions can diversify&lt;br/&gt;their technological profiles by leveraging granular data that relaxes&lt;br/&gt;relatedness assumptions and accounts for broader exogenous contexts]\n    contrib[methodological contribution: relatedness&lt;br/&gt;empirical contribution: exogenous contexts]\n    \n    world --&gt; relevance\n    relevance --&gt; capacity\n    relevance --&gt; change\n    change --&gt; innovation\n    capacity --&gt; innovation\n    innovation --&gt;|how?| combine\n    relevance --&gt; diversification\n    diversification --&gt; relatedness\n    whyrel --&gt; relatedness\n    \n    combine --&gt; footprint\n    footprint --&gt; local\n    local --&gt; products\n    products --&gt; focusregions\n    focusregions --&gt; regionexist\n    \n    relatedness --&gt; suffer\n    suffer --&gt; cooccur\n    cooccur --&gt; oneocc\n    cooccur --&gt; twoocc\n    twoocc --&gt; loss\n    oneocc --&gt; loss\n    \n    loss --&gt; thesis\n    suffer --&gt; thesis\n    regionexist --&gt; thesis\n    regionexist -.-&gt;|exogenous factors:&lt;br/&gt;• neighbouring regions characteristics & outcomes&lt;br/&gt;• national entrepreneurial ecosystem characteristics| thesis\n    thesis --&gt; contrib\n    \n    classDef boxStyle fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef ovalStyle fill:#fff4e6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class combine,whyrel,focusregions,loss,thesis,contrib boxStyle\n    class world,relevance,capacity,change,innovation,diversification,relatedness,footprint,local,products,regionexist,cooccur,oneocc,twoocc,suffer ovalStyle",

    "text": "4 Random forest\nAlgorithmic Framework\nRandom Forest constructs an ensemble of \\(B\\) decision trees through bootstrap aggregating (bagging) with random feature subsampling. For binary classification where \\(y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\), each tree \\(T_b\\) is built on a bootstrap sample \\(\\mathcal{D}_b^*\\) drawn with replacement from the original dataset.\nTree Construction via Recursive Partitioning\nEach tree recursively partitions the feature space through binary splits. At node \\(t\\), we randomly select \\(m\\) features (typically \\(m = \\sqrt{p}\\)) and evaluate all possible splits within this subset. For feature \\(j\\) and threshold \\(\\tau\\), the split creates two child nodes: \\(t_L = \\{i : x_{ij} \\leq \\tau\\}\\) and \\(t_R = \\{i : x_{ij} &gt; \\tau\\}\\).\nGini Impurity as Split Criterion\nSplit quality is assessed via Gini impurity, defined as:\n\\[G(t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{1} p_k^2(t) = 2p_0(t)p_1(t)\\]\nwhere \\(p_k(t) = n_k(t)/n(t)\\) represents the proportion of class \\(k\\) observations at node \\(t\\). Gini impurity quantifies node heterogeneity: \\(G=0\\) indicates perfect purity (homogeneous class), while \\(G=0.5\\) indicates maximum impurity (equal class distribution). The optimal split maximizes the weighted impurity reduction:\n\\[\\Delta G(j, \\tau) = G(t) - \\left[\\frac{n(t_L)}{n(t)} G(t_L) + \\frac{n(t_R)}{n(t)} G(t_R)\\right]\\]\nThe weighting by relative node size prevents trivial splits that isolate single observations into pure but uninformative leaves.\nTermination and Class Assignment\nRecursive splitting continues until predefined stopping criteria are met: node purity (\\(G=0\\)), minimum node size threshold, or maximum tree depth. Terminal nodes are assigned the majority class of their constituent observations.\nEnsemble Prediction\nFor prediction, observation \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) traverses all \\(B\\) trees. The final classification aggregates individual tree predictions via majority voting:\n\\[\\hat{y}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{mode}\\{\\hat{y}_1(\\mathbf{x}), \\ldots, \\hat{y}_B(\\mathbf{x})\\}\\]\nClass probabilities are estimated as the proportion of trees predicting each class:\n\\[\\hat{P}(y=1|\\mathbf{x}) = B^{-1}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbb{I}[\\hat{y}_b(\\mathbf{x})=1]\\]\nInterpreting Probability Estimates\nThis probability represents the empirical vote share across trees. Values near 1 indicate strong consensus for class 1 (high confidence), while values near 0.5 reflect uncertainty with divided predictions. Unlike parametric models, these are purely data-driven vote proportions rather than model-based probability estimates. Practitioners can adjust classification thresholds based on asymmetric misclassification costs.\nVariance Reduction Mechanism\nThe algorithm’s effectiveness stems from variance reduction through decorrelated predictions. Bootstrap sampling and random feature selection reduce inter-tree correlation \\(\\rho\\), yielding ensemble variance:\n\\[\\text{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\rho\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1-\\rho}{B}\\sigma^2\\]\nAs \\(B\\) increases and \\(\\rho\\) decreases, ensemble variance diminishes while maintaining the low bias of flexible tree models.\nFeature Importance\nFeature importance quantifies each predictor’s contribution by aggregating Gini impurity reductions:\n\\[I(j) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{t \\in T_b : v(t)=j} \\Delta G(t)\\]\nwhere the sum runs over all nodes using feature \\(j\\) for splitting. Higher values indicate features consistently creating purer partitions. However, importance measures predictive association rather than causal effect, and suffer from bias toward high-cardinality features and correlated predictor sets. They serve to rank predictive relevance but require caution in causal interpretation.",

    "section": "5.1 Technological Potential",
    "text": "5.1 Technological Potential\nWe follow the methodology proposed by (Albora et al. 2023) for trade data. The methodology named product progression, is based on a machine learning approach that enables researchers to unravel novel aspects of their RCA data. In our case that would be the non-linear dependence between technologies. Our Objective from this phase is to eventually predict whether a region will develop an expertise in a given technology. For reasons of data availability in other data bases that we will use in the next stages, we opted to limit these predictions to an 11 years interval spanning from 2008 to 2018 using data from 4 years ago for each prediction. These predicted probabilities are precisely the regional technological potential. They denote a hypothetical situation that describe for each region, the technologies it has potential to develop expertise in given the relationships that we already modeled.\nWe use Data from the European Patent Office, which contains details on patent applications from 1978 to 2021. The EPO provides a rigorous and detailed classification of each patent application up to 8 or more digits. In our case, we consider the IPC classifications, but since these classifications are extremely granular and are considerably larger than the regions observed (at 8000+ classes), we limit our data to the 4th digit of the IPC classification. These 4 digits contain 3 layers of information with which we can define a given technology, a section denoted by a letter, a class denoted by two digits, and a subclass denoted by another letter. Thus, an IPC class/technology such as F16H is structured hierarchically: Section F covers Mechanical engineering (including lighting, heating, weapons, and blasting), Class 16 pertains to engineering elements and general methods for producing and transmitting mechanical power, and Subclass H specifically addresses gears, shaft connections, and gearing for conveying rotary motion. With such a subset, we ended up with 641 distinct technologies. Additionally, the same data also provides details on where the applications were made, we capture these details at the NUTS2 level2 for 34 European countries within and outside the European Union, spanning across 345 regions. Additionally we also use data from the Eurostat database to incorporate regional level socio-economic factors which are detailed further in section ?sec-factors and summarised in ?tbl-sum.\nFurthermore, we quantify regions’ specialisation by means of the Revealed Comparative Advantage(RCA) (Balassa 1965). In our context, the RCA measures the region’s relative specialization level in a given technology, which enables us to capture both expertise and diversity when we aggregate all the technologies for each region. This measure, also known as the Balassa index, proved useful in determining complex and non-linear relationships between products/activities. Although the RCA is mainly designed for use with international trade data, it has also been adopted in the literature on the geography of innovation. Simply put, the RCA quantifies simultaneously the relative level and the quality of co-occurrence, which reduces the noise in the data. Although some papers criticise the use of the RCA with patent classes (P. Balland and Boschma 2019; Diodato et al. 2023), we think it fits our objective in capturing meaningful relationships between technologies. We compute these RCA measures to obtain, for each year, a matrix denoting the regions in its rows and the technologies in its columns. We formalize it as follows: Let \\(X_{r,t,y}\\) be the measure of activity (patent counts) of region \\(r\\) in technology \\(t\\) during year \\(y\\). Where \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is the set of technologies, \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is the set of years, \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is the set of regions, and \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is the set of countries, such that:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\,t : 1 \\le t \\le N_T\\},\\quad\n\\mathcal{Y} = \\{\\,y : 1 \\le y \\le N_Y\\},\\quad\n\\mathcal{R} = \\{\\,r : 1 \\le r \\le N_R\\},\\quad\n\\mathcal{C} = \\{\\,c : 1 \\le c \\le N_C\\}.\n\\]\nAnd \\(N_T, N_Y, N_R, N_C\\) are the total counts of technologies, years, regions and countries.\nThe RCA of region \\(r\\) in technology \\(t\\) in year \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y}\n= \\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{X_{r,t,y}}{\\sum_{t'} X_{r,t',y}}}\n       {\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sum_{r'} X_{r',t,y}}{\\sum_{r',t'} X_{r',t',y}}}\n= \\frac{X_{r,t,y}\\,\\sum_{r',t'}X_{r',t',y}}\n       {\\bigl(\\sum_{t'}X_{r,t',y}\\bigr)\\,\\bigl(\\sum_{r'}X_{r',t,y}\\bigr)}\n\\]\nFor each year \\(y\\), we then assemble the RCA matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}^{(y)}\\) whose \\((r,t)\\)-entry is \\(\\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y}\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R}^{(y)}\n= \\bigl[\\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y}\\bigr]_{r=1,\\dots,N_{R}}^{t=1,\\dots,N_{T}}\n\\]\nThese yearly measures are essential for us, since our entire approach depends on different manipulations around these stacked matrices.\nThe modeling of the Random Forest algorithm is not intuitive in this proposed methodology. In fact the novelty of the approach proposed by (Albora et al. 2023) is not the use of a tree-based algorithm, but rather to model each technology separately. The idea is to construct a model for every technology in \\(\\mathbf{R}^{(y)}\\) matrix such that the target technology \\(i, i\\in \\mathcal{T}\\) is the outcome and the features are all other technologies different than \\(i\\). The trick here is to binarise the outcome and leave the features as they are for every model we train such that:\n\\[\nz_{r,t,y}\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if }\\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y}\\ge1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe \\(z_{r,t,y}\\) term reflect the capacity of region \\(r\\) at year \\(y\\) for technology \\(t\\). In here capacity means that a region has an advantage/specialised in that specific technology relative to the other regions. Additionally we include a 4 year lag, or a fixed horizon we call delta, \\(\\delta=4\\) in the features since the entire idea is to assess the capacity of the current outcomes based on the past features. This aligns with instincts in the literature in which studies like (Andreoni and Chang 2019) posit that past capacities predict future diversification. Eventually the predicted outcomes describe what technology is possible to develop expertise in, given the observed capacity \\(\\delta\\) years ago. However, as stated in Albora et al. (2023) choosing the value of \\(\\delta\\) is challenging since increasing it decrease the performance of the models. Our choice here, relies on this observation and is the most optimal decision since we train the models for different years instead of just one, thus we need to have for each model at each year of prediction enough observations.\nThe training and testing sets are constructed consequently:\nWe use a fixed horizon (\\(\\delta=4\\)) years to predict future expertise. Let years run from \\(y = y_0...y_f\\), where \\(y_0 = 1978\\) and \\(y_f = 2018\\), let’s also consider the target year of prediction \\(y_t \\in \\{2008,..., 2018\\}\\). We then have:\n\\[\nX_{\\text{train}} = \\{ \\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y} | y \\in [y_0, y_t - 2\\delta]\\},\\quad Y_{\\text{train}} = {z}_{r,t',y} | y \\in [y_0 + \\delta,  y_t - \\delta] \\}\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{\\text{test}} =  \\{ \\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y} |y_t - \\delta\\},\\quad\nY_{\\text{test}} = \\{ z_{r,t,y} |y_t\\}\n\\] Given the complexity of computations, which would require infeasible timing, we conducted cross validation on a random sample of models targeting G06G (Analog computers for data processing), B67B (Closing bottles, jars, or similar containers), D02J (Mechanical finishing or refining of yarns), and C08J (Working-up plastics-processing, recovery, or treatment of waste). Then we chose the parameter values with the most frequency and used them for the rest of the models specifically: mtry = 139, trees = 100, min_n = 38. For our case and computational constraints, this was the only feasible approach. The training was conducted in R using the Ranger package (Wright and Ziegler 2017), with targets (Landau 2021) as a pipeline orchestrator and the tidymodels framework.\nOnce we train our models one for each technology for each of the 11 years (7051 models in total) we obtain at each year, and for each technology, the probability that a region develops expertise. We define this set of probabilities as \\(P(\\mathrm{RCA}_{r,t,y} \\geq 1)\\) which we write simply as \\(p_{r,t,y}\\) and we will refer to these probabilities as the regional technological potential. When we aggregate these probabilities regionally, we obtain the (average) regional potential \\(p_{r,y} = \\frac{\\sum_{t} p_{r,y,t}}{n_t}\\), with \\(n_t\\) the corresponding number of observations.",

    "text": "5.2 Feature Importance Technology Space\nA natural approach to constructing technology networks would be to use patent citation data: if Patent A cites Patent B, and they contain different technologies, this reveals a relationship between those technology domains. However, this approach presents three critical limitations for our purposes. First, EPO citations include examiner-added citations that may not reflect actual knowledge flows between inventors. Second, aggregating patent-level citations to technology-level relationships relies on co-occurrence patterns that obscure the directionality of knowledge dependencies—whether technology A enables B or vice versa. Third, citation networks are inherently backward-looking, reflecting past relationships rather than predicting future technological trajectories.\nTo address these limitations, we adopt the Feature Importance Product Space (FIPS) methodology (Fessina et al. 2024). Rather than inferring relationships from citation co-occurrence, FIPS uses machine learning to identify which existing technology specializations predict future specialization in other technologies. Specifically, we train random forest models where the current presence of regional expertise in technology T is predicted by past expertise patterns across all other technologies. The resulting feature importance scores reveal directional, predictive relationships: if expertise in technology A strongly predicts future expertise in B, this indicates A is a “stepping stone” toward B, even if the reverse is not true. This asymmetric structure captures hierarchical technological dependencies that symmetric co-occurrence measures would miss, and its forward-looking nature aligns with our focus on how current network positions influence future patent value.\n\n\n\nTechnology Network(based on 2018 patent data)\n\n\nFollowing (Fessina et al. 2024), we quantify specialization patterns by means of the Revealed Comparative Advantage(RCA) (Balassa 1965). Although the RCA is mainly designed for use with international trade data, it has also been adopted in the literature of the geography of innovation following the Balland nomenclature (balland2017geography?) we will refer to this metric as the Revealed Technological Advantage(RTA) instead. The RTA measures a location’s relative specialization level in a given technology which enables us to capture both expertise and diversity when we aggregate all the technologies for each location. This measure, proved useful in determining complex and non-linear relationships between products/activities. Simply put, the RTA quantifies simultaneously the relative level and the quality of co-occurrence, which reduces the noise in the network data. Although some papers criticise the use of the RCA/RTA with patents classes [pinheiro2025], we think it fits our objective in capturing meaningful relationships between technologies when we use them in the framework of (Fessina et al. 2024). We compute these measures to obtain for each year a matrix denoting the regions in its rows and the technologies in its columns. We formalize it as follows: Let \\(X_{r,t,y}\\) be the measure of activity (patent counts) of region \\(r\\) in technology \\(t\\) during year \\(y\\). Where \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is the set of technologies, \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is the set of years, and \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) is the set of regions.",
